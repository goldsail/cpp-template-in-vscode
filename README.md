# C++ Project Template for Visual Studio Code + MinGW on Windows

- Step 1: Install MinGW 6.3 to `C:/MinGW/`, and add `C:/MinGW/bin` to `PATH` (environment variables). Restart Visual Studio Code to let the changes apply.

- Step 2: Open this repo as the working directory in Visual Studio Code, with the official C/C++ extension installed.

- Step 3: Press `F5` to start debugging. All `.cpp` files will be compiled into `output.exe` by g++.
